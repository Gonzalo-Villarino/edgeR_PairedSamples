### You can run edgeR_PairedSamples :
##### Two measurements are paired when they come from the same observational unit: before and after, twins, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, matched cases and controls. Pairing is determined by a study's design. It has nothing to do with the actual data values but, rather, with the way the data values are obtained. Observations are paired rather than independent when there is a natural linkbetween an observation in one set of measurements and a particular observation in the other set of measurements, irrespective of their actual values.
